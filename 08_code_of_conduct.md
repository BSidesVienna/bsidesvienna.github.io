Be excellent to each other.

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at BSidesVienna are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooporation from all participants to help ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

# TL;DR
BSidesVienna is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of skill, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

# What is Harassment?

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to skill, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual advances. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors must not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

In case you need anything - Our team is happy to help you!

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. â€¨
We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues, conference-related social events and social media.
