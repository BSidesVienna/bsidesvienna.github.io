# Up your karma: sponsor hacker knowledge aquisition
Getting a community event going (possibly for free) is not easy. We're looking for sponsoring to provide
for a nice and central location, multiple tracks, tech (beamers, PA, recording equipment), and ideally
food and drinks for attendees. If you are interested to help an event by the security community - for the
security community please contact us either [via twitter](https://twitter.com/BSidesVienna) or send us an
e-mail to crew [at] bsidesvienna [dot] at. Note that BSides is not a vendor marketing event, but you're more
than welcome to participate in any way you feel appropriate.
