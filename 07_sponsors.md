# Up your karma: sponsor hacker knowledge aquisition

Getting a community event going (possibly for free) is not easy. We're looking for sponsoring to provide
for a nice and central location, multiple tracks, tech (beamers, PA, recording equipment), and ideally
food and drinks for attendees. If you are interested to help an event by the security community - for the
security community please contact us either [via twitter](https://twitter.com/BSidesVienna), [via Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@bsidesvienna) or send us an e-mail to crew [at] bsidesvienna [dot] at. [We also published our sponsor levels including the perks you
will get here](/sponsorlevel/).
