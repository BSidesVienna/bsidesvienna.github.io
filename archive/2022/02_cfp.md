You can't keep a good con down... so after a year off sunning ourselves BSidesVienna is back for 2022!

We're teaming up with the very fine folks over at [DeepSec](https://deepsec.net/) again to throw a BSides event straight after their conference at the
end of November. In true BSides fashion we're looking for a good mix of security and hacker talks
designed to wow the crowd and keep them coming back for more.

If you want to get a feel of what we're looking for, check out the [archive](/archive/) of our past BsidesVienna events:

- 2019: [Talk schedule](http://bsidesvienna.at/archive/2019/schedule/) (slides included)
- 2017: [Talk schedule](http://bsidesvienna.at/archive/2017/schedule/) (slides included)
- 2016: [Talk schedule](http://bsidesvienna.at/archive/2016/schedule/) (slides included)
- 2015: [Talk schedule](http://bsidesvienna.at/archive/2015/schedule/) (slides included)
- 2014: [Talk schedule](http://bsidesvienna.at/archive/2014/schedule/) (slides included)

We are currently seeking a selection of presentations and shorter (15-minute) lightning talks.
BSides is an open, international event, the official conference language for all talks, trainings and workshops
(as well as submitted abstracts) is English to ensure our foreign friends don't feel all sad panda about missing
things.

Topics of interest include (but are in no way limited to) the following:


- Information technology
- Network security & Cryptography
- Web Application security
- Mobile security
- Usable security
- Virtualization and cloud computing
- Innovative attack / defense strategies
- Forensics / Malware
- Embedded device security / IoT
- Physical security and lockpicking
- Biometrics
- Hardware hacking
- Phreaking
- Biohacking and modification
- Open source software
- Robotics (bonus points for bringing an actual robot)
- Massive abuse of technology
- Evolutionary computing
- History & Philosophy of computing
- Ethical and philosophical implications of hacking
- Disrupting politics & society (in a constructive way)
- Creating and maintaining safe-spaces & encouragement of female participation

The Jargon Lexicon contains [a nice definition](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) we think fits very well here:

```txt
hacker: n.

[...]

7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.

[...]
```
