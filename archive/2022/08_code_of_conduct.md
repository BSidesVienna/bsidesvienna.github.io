# Code of Conduct [CoC]
All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at BSidesVienna are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooporation from all participants to help ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

#### TL;DR
Walk your talk. Be excellent to each other || GTFO!

BSidesVienna is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of skill, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Think about your speech and how it might affect/offend others around you. Offensive sexual language and imagery is not appropriate and entirely unprofessional for any conference venue, in partciular in workshops and talks.
Conference participants (including sponsors, staff and volunteers) violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the venue at the discretion of- and after deliberation by the organisers.

#### What is Harassment?

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to skill, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual advances.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors must not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

In case you need anything - Our team is happy to help you!

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. 
We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues, conference-related social events and social media.
