# Propaganda

You can't keep a good con down... so after a year off sunning ourselves BSidesVienna is back for 2014!

Just because we like to change things up, this time around we're teaming up with the very fine folks
over at [DeepSec](https://deepsec.net/) to throw a BSides event straight after their conference at the
end of November. In true BSides fashion we're looking for a good mix of security and hacker talks
designed to wow the crowd and keep them coming back for more.


We are currently seeking a selection of hands-on workshops, presentations and shorter (15-minute) lightning talks.
BSides is an open, international event, the official conference language for all talks, trainings and workshops
(as well as submitted abstracts) is English to ensure our foreign friends don't feel all sad panda about missing
things.

Topics of interest include (but are in no way limited to) the following:


- Information technology
- Network security
- Web Application security
- Mobile security
- Virtualization and cloud computing
- Innovative attack / defense strategies
- Forensics / Malware
- Embedded device security / Internet of things
- Physical security and lockpicking
- Biometrics
- Hardware hacking
- Phone phreaking
- Biohacking
- Open source software
- Evolutionary computing
- Robotics (bonus points for bringing an actual robot)
- Massive abuse of technology

# Submission
To apply, please provide the details of your talk proposal and contact info [via easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bsv14).


CFP will close on ~~30th September 2014~~ **18th October 2014 23:59:59**.
