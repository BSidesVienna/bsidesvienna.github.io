We're looking for high quality submissions in the fields of information security, reverse engineering, incident response, security operations and basically on everything that has [hack value](https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Hack_value.html).

Deadline and a CFP will be announced soon.
